                    In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_cuisine" title="Afghan cuisine" target="_blank">Afghan cuisine</a>, 
                    the thinly rolled out dough of the mantu is filled with beef or lamb mixed with minced onions and spices, 
                    steamed and then topped with a yoghurt-based sauce. The sauce (<i>seer mosst</i>,
                    lit. "garlic yoghurt") is made with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaka_(food)" class="mw-redirect" title="Chaka (food)" target="_blank">chaka</a> 
                    (thick, creamy, strained and salted yoghurt), lemon juice, dried and fresh mint, green and red 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chili_powder" title="Chili powder" target="_blank">chili powder</a> and pressed 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garlic" title="Garlic" target="_blank">garlic</a>. The mantu can also be topped with a tomato-based sauce 
                    which can include split peas or red kidney beans and/or sautéed 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_meat" title="Ground meat" target="_blank">ground meat</a>. This depends on the meat that was used for 
                    the filling of the mantu. The amount of yoghurt sauce is typically more than the tomato and ground meat sauce; 
                    the sauce is meant to be dotted on top so as to not cover the entire dish. However, separate dishes containing 
                    more of the ground meat, split peas, tomato sauce, and yoghurt sauce may also be kept at the table or

                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korma" title="Korma" target="_blank">qorma</a> or stew, instead of a tomato-based sauce. Now it is also famous 
                        in some areas of Pakistan due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghans_in_Pakistan" title="Afghans in Pakistan" target="_blank">Afghan refugees</a>.
                        <sup id="cite_ref-Saberi_2000_87_23-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghans_in_Pakistan#cite_note-Saberi_2000_87-23" target="_blank">[23]</a></sup>
                        The authentic Afghan mantu dumplings are supposed to be small and bite-sized. The dough is supposed to be thinned 
                        out so that it is not chewy to bite on nor should one feel like they are eating more dough than filling. 
                        There is a specific pattern in which the dough of each dumpling is twisted and closed around the filling. 
                        There is a variation of this dish in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan" title="Afghanistan" target="_blank">Afghanistan</a> known as 
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aushak" title="Aushak" target="_blank">aushak</a>, in which the filling is different and it is made by boiling 
                        the dumplings instead of steaming them.

                            <li>Combine flour, yeast, 150ml water, 2 teaspoons oil, and 0.5 teaspoons salt in a bowl and mix. The dough should be soft and not stick to your hands. Let the dough rest for about 30 minutes.</li>
